# admin-scripts

Here I store some simple (and useful) scripts to perform some basic admin task.


- [mgmt_branch](mgmt_branch.sh): simple script to create/delete/merge branches with git.

- [need_reboot](need_reboot.sh): check a list of server to see with they needed reboot due to apt updates.

- [disk_space](disk_space.sh): list the disk space on remote server using SSH
